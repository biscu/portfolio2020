								The current version of the desktop website decathlon.co.uk, after a preliminary interaction with it, showed some usability issues regarding the shopping process: clothes size are not explicitly stated in the product page, but there is a window showing the “size as expected” review form other customers, then the user is forced to create an account before continuing to the checkout, there is no option to purchase as a guest (as the main competitor Jd sports allows that).

							<h3>Can Decathlon customers shop easily on decathlon.co.uk?
							</h3>
							<p class="paragraph">
								The checkout process of any website is the most crucial part of the online shopping process and the success of the business. It has been estimated that the average customer dropout rate at the checkout is around 70%.(Baymart Institute). Customer should easily search and buy items they likes without any obstacles, distractions and they should be given all the right information they need to make an aware choice. Task 1 aims to test how easy, reliable and consistent the process of buy an article on the website is, and spot usability problems in the checkout process. <br><br>
							</p>

							<h3>Can Decathlon customers easily find information about in-store services?
							</h3>
							<p class="paragraph">
								As a sport retailer Decathlon offers a wide range of service related to sport equipment such as maintain and repair of bike, ski and snowboard and clothes customisation. Even thought their are explicit promoted inside the store there is not reference from the home page to the actual service section of the web site. Task 3 focuses on the ease of use in finding the current and useful information about decathlon in-shore services.<br><br>
							</p>

							<h3>Can Decathlon customers easily engage in events organised by Decathlon?
							</h3>
							<p class="paragraph">
								Decathlon aims to expand its community of sportsman, and increasing its audience, by organising free activity class in its store. Only in London there are only ten store, couple of them are in a central position, and others in suburban area. Does Decathlon provide the right information and directions to the user in order to let him easily find the best store? Task 4 aims to understand how the user can find information about fitness classes and also how are the classes organized and displayed on the website. Are they filtered by Sport? Or by Store?

								Study Method
							</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12 mb-5 mb-md-0">
							<p class="paragraph">
								The purpose of this evaluation was to highlight usability and accessibility issues in the website. A usability test has been conducted on five users to which has been given different tasks to complete while recording their interaction on screen and their voice. This approach gives us both qualitative data, obtained from the self-reported questionnaire, and quantitative, obtained during the observation of the participants carrying on the task. <br><br>

								To gathers insightful data the “think aloud” protocol has been used. The participants were asked to say what are they were looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling during the interaction with the interface. The usability test has been conducted in a setting in which the participants felt comfortable and appropriate: their home or office.

							<p class="paragraph">
								As recommended by the ISO/IEC 9126-4 Metrics usability metrics should include: <br><br>

								Effectiveness: To measure effectiveness the metric used were Completion Rate with an assigned value of 1 or 0. The number of error made by the participant when attempting to complete a task.<br><br>

								Efficiency: Task time, measured in seconds, was used as a metric to measure efficiency.<br><br>

								Satisfaction: User satisfaction is measured through standardized satisfaction questionnaires, in this case, an After Scenario Questionnaire composed of 3 question, in a form of a scale with the minimum value of 1 and a maximum of 5, has been proposed to the participant after the completion of every task.

								Overall findings
							</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12 mb-5 mb-md-0">
							<p class="paragraph">
								The overall experience on the website is discordant: data gathered from the first task showed a satisfying experience on the checkout process although some usability issue has emerged. On the other hand, both quantitative and qualitative data showed flaws and far more severe usability issues regarding the “Guide Size”, “Workshop” and “Event” page. <br><br>

								The main Checkout issue that came to light is the mandatory account creation in order to purchase any item on the website. A study report from Baymard.com states that 34% of user abandons the website during checkout because they are forced to create an account. <br><br>

								The the most unclear input fields on the Profile Creation Form were: the surname was cap locked while the name wasn’t. The mobile phone was mandatory. Password requirements weren’t clear and users tried more than once to meet those requirements. Also the progress tracker that shows the different stage on the checkout progress did not allow the user to go back clicking the proper tab. <br><br>

								Both Size and Workshop page were really difficult to find since they are directly visible in the footer of the website. Most user tried to use the search bar to find the information they needed but failed (only one user successfully typed the correct key word to receive the correct page back as result of the query). <br><br>

								Event page’s weak point is the filter system to find the closest store. The option to fliter by postcode is missing in the main page, but the user can find a similar tool on the single event page. Important information regarding the event are scattered all over 6 section really hard to reach easily because of the static scroll system, oddly present only in that pages, making this part of the website really inconsistent with the rest of it.
